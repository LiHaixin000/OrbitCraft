## Proposal for Orbital 24

### Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

The vast student population can often make it difficult for students to find peers with similar academic interests or access mentorship opportunities that could significantly enhance their educational journey. This realization has led us to conceptualize an innovative solution aimed at fostering these essential connections.

### Aim
Our mission is to transform how NUS students engage academically and socially within their university environment. With the introduction of our platform, we aim to:

- Enhance Academic Collaboration
- Facilitate Mentorship Connections

### Features
1. **Mentorship Matching System**: Connects students with alumni and industry professionals for mentorship.
2. **Study Group Formation Tool**: Allows students to create, discover, and join study groups within their course or subject area.

### User Stories

2. **Student Facing Course Difficulties**: Find study groups or tutors to enhance understanding and performance.
